Let's make a game. Use best cookbook practises for your LLM (claude 4.5 sonnet).

The game should be an all-inclusive Casino game with many various card games, and a couple of slots games. The user should be able to play with the arrow keys and spacebar and mouse. Wagers must be able to be raised. 

The goal of the game is to, once the player enters the casino with their 200 EUR, to win 2000 EUR collectively across the various casino games. The game must track the player's money status at all times. Small wager is 0.2 EUR, Big wager is 5 EUR. There should be other levels in between. 

Each game must have a button that shows its individual payout table. 

Let's say the casino has three different poker games, one craps, one roulette, and two slots games. And there should be a menu where the user can choose which game to pick, and a way to return to the menu after a playing round.

The user is ALWAYS called Jan-Erik and the game should specify in many places and pop-ups that this is a 40th anniversary gift to the player. For instance, by rewarding the player for simply being awesome. And "forty but still sexy".
All the games must be visual, not text-based. Also, the elements in all games must NOT overlap. The dimensions must therefore be planned very meticulously. 
The cards in the card games should be as big as possible, and a lock mechanism must exist for video poker. 
Make sure you can test the game. And visual components must be terrific.
